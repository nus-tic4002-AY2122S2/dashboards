Hello, I have been searching high and low for a solution to my problem but I can't seem to find one.

This is under `A-JUnit`, been following this [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/junit.html).

When I do this `7b. Run the test (right-click on the class and choose Run DukeTest).`, I get the error down below.

I believe it's due to my project structure, but I'm not sure how to fix it.

Appreciate any help please! Thank you in advance!

Hi @declanleeler ! I suppose you're running from the CLI instead of using IntelliJ's run button. Check these 2 issues (#1 and #11) out. They might help.

Do you have any other java files other than `Duke.java`?

When I ran `runtest.sh` from the CLI instead of using IntelliJ, I had to be in the `text-ui-test` directory.

Inside the `runtest.sh`, Line 16 onwards:
```shell
# compile the code into the bin folder, terminates if error occurred
if ! javac -cp ../src/main/java -Xlint:none -d ../bin ../src/main/java/*.java // This part!
then
    echo "********** BUILD FAILURE **********"
    exit 1
fi
```

Maybe you could double check the directory of all your java files based on the path specified in the run test script and amend accordingly.

@damithc Hello prof, yes I have actually read that a few times and studied Levels 7 and 8 before working. I feel that the highlighted could mean after finishing Levels 7 and 8? Both levels don't seem to have much of a connection as @Yukun99 has mentioned, also based on what we need to implement for each level. 

I understood the highlighted sentence in this way:
```git
From master:
git checkout -b branch-Level-7 // Work on Level-7

Then, once completing Level-7, again from master:
git checkout -b branch-Level-8

Then, we'll merge them one after another.
```

But prof I suppose, either way works (i.e. Doing Levels 7 and 8 respectively then merging or merging `Level-7` with `master` then doing `Level-8` and merging again)? :sweat_smile:

public class TaskTest {

I followed the instructions in this [link](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/junit.html) (under Intellij, without gradle) closely and repeated the steps twice but :')

A little more info: I started off iP using VSCode, and just moved to IntelliJ to do JUnit portion not sure if I need to generate any files for the project folder.

Yes I have done that too. For the past hour, I have been trying to setup on VSCode too for JUnit but can't seem to get it working either, using this [(Extension Pack for Java (VSCode))](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/extensions).

I'm re-cloning the entire repo and re-doing the JUnit setup for IntelliJ. Will check back and update in 5 minutes! Thanks!

It seems that I might have forgotten to configure the SDK for the project when loading into IntelliJ.

Followed what @Spyobird said with trying out Step 8, `File -&gt; Project Structure -&gt; ...`,

Realised this was empty. I remembered setting the Project's SDK when I was prompted for the first time though, there were 2 options I think I selected the wrong one :')

I'll write some tests for the `Task` portion and see if everything works out fine, and will close this thread.

Thank you so much for your help! @AAlghrairy @damithc @Spyobird 🍻 

Also, if anyone is using VSCode, did you manage to setup for JUnit tests? Would love to figure that out. Should've been quite straightforward with the Extension for Java extension but doesn't seem to work... 😭

<hr>

Things I've tried:
1. I have followed this here:
```
8b. Now that you have the modules main and test, you can set up the dependency using one of these options:

Option 1: When you add a reference to the Duke inside the DukeTest, Intellij will flag it as an error and will give you an option (i.e., in the bulb icon that pops up) to add the main module as a dependency.
```

2. Rebuilding project & `File -&gt; Invalidate Caches -&gt; Restart`

<hr>

The codes for the test file:
```java
package duke.task;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class TaskTest {
    @Test
    public void dummyTask() {
        Task task = new Task("Test Task", 'T');

        assertEquals("Test Task", task.getDescription());
        assertEquals('T', task.getType());
        assertEquals(false, task.getCompleted());

Hi @Btaykb ! It seems like you might have accidentally removed `ip` as the dependency.

Could you go to `File -&gt; Project Structure` and see if you've these?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46486515/150917805-0fd68738-d201-4e53-a2f1-d9aad5ebad3c.png)

If not, you might have to redo the [entire setup](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/junit.html).

Also, point 8 in the JUnit link is important.

As mentioned by prof with the link, I faced quite a few issues when setting up. I've been doing mine in VSCode and moved to IntelliJ for the JUnit part.

You could run `rm -rf .idea *.iml` with your terminal and restart IntelliJ, see if it works.

Ensure you've saved all your files (i.e. Everything before `A-JUnit`) remotely, incase of rollbacks.

Keep this thread updated, I'll check back!

@Btaykb hello, not sure what went wrong there... That command basically does a kind of 'reset' so that when you restart IntelliJ, it generates those folders and its contents again.

Yes, would be better if you redid the entire process!

I checked your repo, everything looks good (as how it should be before doing `A-JUnit`). Basically, delete the entire project folder locally, then clone again and open in IntelliJ and follow the steps outlined in the JUnit setup!

Hi @joey-chance ! I think it is best if you could do this... Or at least I did it to overcome any differences when copying and pasting:

```
javac Duke.java; java Duke < input.txt > output.txt
```

Then just copying from `output.txt` to `EXPECTED.TXT`.

Not sure if you've done it this way or it will help your case..

Hello,

the issue you are facing may be due to [token authentication](https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/) for HTTPS. Perhaps you could try one of these solutions.

Setting your authentication credential to the git remote URL:
`git remote set-url origin https://yourusername@github.com/user/repo.git`

Creating a personal access token:
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

Alternatively you can try and use SSH, which might be less hassle in the future.

I am not a mac user but hope this may help resolve the issue.

<panel  header="**2 :fas-comment:**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S2/forum/issues/4#issuecomment-1014687316" expanded>

I believe that you can set the expiration for the personal access token. I think the default duration is 30 days, but you probably can set it longer, even to no expiration I believe (although that might have security implications). The point of personal access tokens is to be temporal. This allows it to be unique and random which preserves its authenticity, however you could probably set one that covers the duration of the module so you don't have to worry about it too much.

As for SSH, its benefit is so that you don't have to constantly re-enter your credentials whenever you want to use git commands, which can save with some hassle. Although that being said you could probably cache your personal access token for it to behave in a similar way (auto-filling passwords).

I believe SourceTree has OAuth support too, which may just simplify the entire issue of connecting with HTTPS/SSH. However, I am not sure if there would be any other issues when using OAuth. At the end of the day, it is just using the method which works for you.

Hi,

I believe that when you reverted a commit you ended up with a local branch with a detached HEAD. Usually HEAD points to the master branch (or whatever is the branch you are working on). The first error is just the name of the branch has spaces which is not allowed by naming convention. To return the HEAD back to the master branch, you might just be able to use a git checkout or git switch command. `git checkout master` may work. Pushing straight to the master branch may also return HEAD to master.

Seeing that you reverted your commit, maybe you wanted to make changes in your new local branch (the detached HEAD). You can always merge your changes to the master branch once you are done, just remember to rename the branch to something that follows the conventions (https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-check-ref-format.html).

The second error you have is because you are pushing the 'Level-3' tag to the remote repo (github.com), but the tag already exits on the remote repo. You can either not push the tag (as it is already there) or delete the tag on the remote repo and push it again.

I hope what I said is correct. Anyways hope it helps!

Hi, I don't think there is a right way to handle exceptions (although there are poorer ways ie. control flow). At the end of the day, whatever works best for you is good, although it is nice to keep OOP principles in mind. Coupled with the iterative breadth-first approach this module takes, I think it is also good practice to continually change the design of your code each week to meet the requirements. As for enums, use it whenever you want to! You could even use enums to differentiate the different exceptions/errors if you wanted to. I used enums in a very simple way to differentiate marked tasks and unmarked tasks, meanwhile I used polymorphism to differentiate exceptions. Hope it helps! :)

Writing on each execution may be 'slower' and 'more inefficient', however, writing on termination may not result in the changes being saved in the event of unexpected termination of the program (e.g. crashes, ctrl+C). It is possible to handle those cases through error handling though.

If your void methods still mutate some other variable, you can always test the mutated variable too see if the changes are expected. If not you can always change the void methods to boolean if you want assurance that a method has been called.

Not sure if this is the solution but perhaps don't throw exceptions on your main method.

Perhaps your classpath is also set wrong (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17408769/how-do-i-resolve-classnotfoundexception).

Hello, I am using IntelliJ 2019.2, Java version 11.0.2.
When I run the runtest.sh file I receive this error:

I did search for some answers and came across a Stackoverflow post (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20587840/javac-file-not-found-first-java-usage-javac-options-source-files/20587857) that says I need to set JRE path but im not sure what that means?

Hi @domlimm I tried IntelliJ and CLI but unfortunately I get the error on both. I tested out on `Duke.java` and `*.java` too but the error stays the same.

IntelliJ was working fine up till this stag of the project so I don' think so since I am able to run the Java files from Intellij. The reason why I switched to terminal is because I was tracing through the javac file not found error in the shellscript and realized that I could not even run javac commands in my terminal.

Dear all,

I have completed my iP week 2 tasks on time, but it seems that the dashboard is not reflecting my tags beyond Level-4.

(So A-TextUiTesting, Level-5, and Level-6 are not reflected even after the dashboard was refreshed after I committed the tags already)

Moreover, on the iP code dashboard, it shows that I have 0 lines of code written, which is not the case.

I was wondering whether this is my fault on using the git commands.

Here is how I committed after done with each increment.

`git add .`
`git commit -m "With some messages"`
`git tag -a "tagName"`
`git push origin tagName`

I can see all my commits if I click on master branch -&gt; Tags -&gt; and appropriate level tags.

Sorry, there was a typo in my post, the last command should have been `git push origin Tagname`, so in a sense, I believe I pushed the tags explicitly to my remote repository. But I can only see them if I click on master branch -&gt; Tags -&gt; and appropriate level tags.

@damithc 

Hi prof, thanks for your input. But I got a little confused now.

So if I do `git push origin tagName`, (this I followed our website), where does that commit go? 

Do I have to push two times? (one for tag and one for master)

For me, when considering todo, event, and deadline command, I check these conditions:

Whether content of the task is specified. (an empty content, or delimiter follows immediately after the command)
Whether the schedule is specified (delimiter not specified at all or after delimiter no schedule is written)

For others, I only accept the "correct" conditions and all else will throw an exception.

What I did was for an every operation that involved modifying the TaskList (e.g. adding a task or marking/unmarking), my Storage class would evoke save method and save the result back to the txt file. But now that I think of it, I believe I could only save the file for bye command, but like @Spyobird mentioned, sudden termination must be handled in such case.

Hi, I'm at A-TextUiTesting after level-4 of the iP. I encounter this error when running the "runtest.bat" file:
```
java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: Duke has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 55.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 52.0
Error: A JNI error has occurred, please check your installation and try again
Exception in thread "main"
```
I'm using Windows. At first, this error occurs also when I run "runtest.bat" directly (double-click), so I downloaded and installed the Oracle OpenJDK 11.0.13 and added the path to the system environment variables. Now it works properly when I double-click to run it, but I need to compare the actual and expected outputs manually. However, the error still appears when I run it in IntelliJ, and it fails to produce the actual output, despite that I have changed both the JDK home path in File > Project Structure and the Boot Java Runtime (see the figure) to Oracle OpenJDK 11.0.13. I have also recompiled the Duke project.

> If that doesn't work, you can also try using SSH which is the more convenient imo as you don't have to type in your username and password every time you push (which may be the cause of the problem?). Set your remote as `git@github.com:se-edu/AdrianOngJJ/CS2103T-Test.git`, [create a new ssh key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent), and add your public key to github so all subsequent pushes will not require your github username and password. I hope that'll help!

@kevinchua6 Thanks for the reply! I did a little more digging and found out that I could either use the HTTPS method or your SSH method. I've studied the SSH method but I felt a bit too confusing (my coding command is bad). Here are some's a SS of my attempt to use the SSH method:

However, I've found the solution by referring to [this](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git). Idk if changing the visibility of my repo from **Private** to **Public** made a difference.

Ok I've found the solution. Sorry for not looking it further first. Here's what I've [found](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12224773/refname-master-is-ambiguous/12225704#12225704).

TL,DR: My tag shared the same name as the branch (which is `Level-1`, which confused Git. To fix, I [changed the name of the branch](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12224773/refname-master-is-ambiguous/12225704#12225704) to `level1` in order to retain the tag `Level-1`. From there, I ran `git checkout master` to go back to `master` branch, followed by `git merge level1` to update the `Duke.java` file.

just checking, have you restarted IntelliJ (or maybe rebooted your entire computer) after updating your system env vars? i'm not too familiar with Windows, but there's a chance that IntelliJ is still using the old $PATH or something

perhaps try adding `echo %PATH%` and `java -version` to runtest.bat, and running runtest.bat to see if what you get is what you're expecting

that's not what I meant -- `src/main/data/duke.txt` is a relative path, so if your current/working directory isn't `C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Documents\CS\CS2103\ip`, your program isn't going to be able to find your file (or `src`, or `src/main`, etc)

Hi all, I was trying to use a while loop for the main logic in Duke.
However I got into an infinite loop, where the "bye" command was supposed to end the java program.
Below is a summary of the main loop.
```java
Boolean over;
while(!over) {
        if (command instanceof bye) {
            itIsOver(over);
        }
    }
}
```

the body of the method 'itIsOver' simply does the following.
```java
over = true;
```

From my understanding, the fact that Boolean is a wrapper class of boolean tells me that the 'over' variable in the main loop should change to a 'true' value. I failed to find a reason in the internet. Any help would be grateful!

Hi all, I am trying to understand what the -u option does in the command 'git push -u {remote} {branch}'

I know, the module website does specify

The also looked at the documentation, which says

>--set-upstream
>For every branch that is up to date or successfully pushed, add upstream (tracking) reference, used by argument-less git-pull[1] and other commands. For more information, see branch.&gt;name>.merge in git-config[1].

However, both didn't really get to me... I would be happy if someone can explain what 'track the new upstream branch' specifically means, or how does it affect what I can do, or my local/remote git repo!

@lkldev  Thank you for your suggestion! But... It seems unrelated with the if statement. To make sure, I already tested with a separate code that looks like the following.
```java
Boolean over;
while(!over) {
        System.out.println("if successful, this line will be printed only once");
        itIsOver(over);

This also resulted in infinite printing of the String.

Hi everyone!

I was working on the extension `A-More-OOP` and `A-Packages` so I refactored some of my classes. Even though I manage to get the expected output when running `Duke.main()`, I was unable to properly run `runtest.sh`, because it kept showing a runtime error. 

After investigating, I realised that the bin still contained the deprecated class files from the previous increments, which caused the runtime error because the code is no longer valid. 

For people with this error, you can run `rm -r ./bin` in console, and rebuild your `text-ui-test`. 

Check and make sure that your path is correct for your `javac` and `java` command.

For the `java` command, run with the `/bin packageName.javafile` instead of `/bin/packageName javafile`.

Hope this helps!

Hi, 
Just to check, does this project structure work? Currently under the Project tab, I only have 2 modules - src/main and src/test:
<img width="330" alt="Screenshot 2022-01-26 at 11 53 56 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77088875/151197989-bc8ab469-6ef6-41e2-ba77-499c4ba702f4.png">

As per the instructions on the website, to view other subfolders in iP such as text-ui-test, I have to change tab to Project Files:

However, when I try to run iP/text-ui-test/runtest.sh after completing the increment for A-JUnit, a build failure is thrown and I am not very sure if it is because of my project structure. 

<img width="985" alt="Screenshot 2022-01-26 at 11 51 52 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77088875/151198529-85e12a11-1ca6-4689-a10c-9e8a667e4966.png">


Is iP supposed to be a module, and both src/main and src/test modules inside iP? If so, is there a way for me to rectify my current project structure?

Thank you so much!! :)

As stated in the moreOOP level, a storage class is needed to handle file reading and writing.

The thing is, when i run duke.main, it works, but upon creating the jar file, it gives the error

"Exception in thread "main" java.io.IOException: The system cannot find the path specified

        at duke.Storage.readFile(Storage.java:13)
        at duke.Duke.main(Duke.java:21)"

This means that the file path to be read which is "src/main/data/duke.txt" works in run duke.main but not in the jar file. 

I suspect that it has something to do with how the artifact settings are set and where the manifest.mf file is.

Currently my folder structure looks like that, not sure if main is supposed to be a module (after doing A-JUnit)

Also, upon checking, it does appear that I have deleted ip as a dependency as I misunderstood the point on deleting any extraneous module before adding the main module in the JUnit guide.

@damithc oh wait. Yup that was the issue all along! Apparently at some point through the JUnit setup, duke was added as a package prefix, which caused all my package names to include that extra duke.

@Spyobird for the first method, is it a long-term solution? Or is it a short-term solution like the personal access token? I tried the personal access token method and it worked haha. But since the token has an expiry date it's a short-term solution, right?

I wasn't really sure how to do the first method, does this mean that if I were to do the first method, I would have to type `git remote set-url origin https://yuqitanyq@github.com/user/ip.git` in my terminal? 

Are both solutions short-term solutions and ssh is the one that will work for every repo in the future if I use source tree?

Hi, interesting question about enums! I was trying out using enums for the various commands and I decided to use two enums to help me handle the commands. The first enum `ActionType` would be to group the command into various types, such as `READ`, `UPDATE`, `ADD`, and `NO_ACTION`. The next enum `CommandAction` would be to create all the commands (`todo`, `list`, `deadline` etc) and tie them accordingly to `ActionType`. This enum will also contain information such as their required arguments etc. This way, I can easily use a hashmap to tie the input to the right command (and its arguments) and when handling exceptions, I can handle by their `ActionType` for some cases. For instance, the `UPDATE` `ActionType` commands would include `mark`, `unmark`, and `delete`, which all would require an index. When parsing the command, I can do something like:
```
switch(ActionType) {
    ...
    case UPDATE:
        if (args.length < 2) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(String.format("The index of %s cannot be empty.", args[0]));
        }
    ...
}
```
However, after looking at [se-edu/addressbook-level2](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level2), I feel that enums may not be the best way to parse the commands, as creating the various commands as classes seem to allow for better polymorphism. Hopefully, this help with your question regarding how enums can be used!

Hi, i believe you will need to update your path in runtest.sh. for the `javac` command, you should add `pikabot` to it, so something like
```bash
javac  -cp ..\src\main\java -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\pikabot\*.java
```
Then you should update the `java` command to run your package pikabot, e.g.
```bash
java -classpath ..\bin pikabot.PikaBot < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT
```

Ah sorry, I misunderstood your question. In java, the [primitive wrapper classes are immutable](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/primitive-wrapper-classes-are-immutable-in-java/). Hence, the Boolean over cannot be changed by another function if you pass by reference. For your code to work, `itIsOver` will have to return a boolean and assign it back to `over`, so something like `over = isItOver()`.

I think this was the method that I eventually used, as using the enums this way helps with refactorability in later iterations. Especially if the number of input command grows, behavior and exception handling can be tied to the Command enum. Thanks everyone for your help!. I will now be closing this thread.

Hey all,

I am pretty unfamiliar to Git, and am facing troubles trying to push my commit to myfork(origin) on SourceTree as well. 
This is what my current branching looks like, because I used the "reverse commit" function:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77261002/150095146-db358f12-865f-4ba4-9ccd-0876f4338689.png)

Now when I try to push, I have the option to push either 'master', or '(HEAD Detached from 35a4f9d)'. There are errors when pushing either.
When I try to push the HEAD, it says:

The Local branch '(HEAD detached from 35a4f9d)' (Remote branch = '(HEAD detached from 35a4f9d)') is invalid. Ref names must follow git ref-format rules: 
https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-check-ref-format.html
Completed with errors, see above.


When I try to push master, it says:

Pushing to https://github.com/janald99/ip.git
To https://github.com/janald99/ip.git
 = [up to date]      master -&gt; master

 = [up to date]      Level-2 -&gt; Level-2
 ! [rejected]        Level-3 -&gt; Level-3 (already exists)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/janald99/ip.git'
 hint: Updates were rejected because the tag already exists in the remote.
Completed with errors, see above.

So firstly, how do I attach the HEAD tag back? Or do I even have to do it - in which case, which branch should I push and of course, how do I fix the error?

Thanks for the help in advance, even though there are so many errors in one request.

This is more of an "extension" of Level-5, and maybe enums.

I was cleaning up some of my code before starting on week 3 stuff and was thinking about the error-handling portion and had the following questions:

1. What are the edge cases you guys considered?
    * These are mine (on top of the given example):
      * out of bounds
      * no delimiters (`/at` or `/by`)
      * index not being a number
2. How did you guys organise the error-handling portion for yours?
3. Is there a convention for error-handling?
4. How do you _actually_ use enums?

Currently I'm just throwing `DukeExceptions` with the respective messages and tried to account for the edge cases but that doesn't seem "right".

I've also separated my "commands" into an enums class and did all the responses and error-checks there. 

I was thinking that this was the way as it would clean up a the main Duke and it _felt_ like enums was where all the responses/actions (mark/unmark/delete) _should_ happen. During the code clean-up, however, I realised that all I'm doing is just making it messier in my enums class (example below), and had me thinking about how to properly (conventionally) approach this.

```java
public void toggleMarkResponse(List<Task> taskList, String cmd, String toggleIdx) throws DukeException {
    if (taskList.isEmpty()) { throw new DukeException("The list is empty!"); }
    if (!argumentsCheck(toggleIdx)) { throw new DukeException("Invalid number of arguments!"); }

    // checks input to see if it's a number, throws DukeException if it can't be parsed
    int index = isValidInt(toggleIdx) - 1; 
    if (!isValidIndex(index, taskList.size())) { throw new DukeException("Entry out of range!"); }

    {... mark/unmark logic ...}

    {... all the System.out stuff ...}
}
```

@jbkim1999 thanks for pointing out regarding the content of task and the schedule, that slipped my mind! (Looks like I'll have to add 2 more conditions 😆 )

---

@lkldev I think your approach might be the way, at least from a code-organisation perspective. I wanted to do something similar but opted not. I gave it some thought and realised that it might look cleaner, but that's adding another "layer" of passing arguments, which isn't necessarily bad, but I've had the bad habit of over-complicating simple tasks (which is also why I posted this question to see if what I had was over-engineered 🤣 ). 

> after looking at se-edu/addressbook-level2, I feel that enums may not be the best way to parse the commands

Agreed! But while polymorphism (and cleaner code) is off the table, overloading still can be used, though it is not as ideal, and I personally got very confused and resorted to making different exceptions/responses according to the respective enums.

I've actually done something similar to yours --
<details>
<summary> Click here to see the code </summary>

``` java
switch (inputCmd) {
// ...
case TODO:
case EVENT:
case DEADLINE:
    if (input.length == 2) { // here I've used .split(" ") to split the command from description
        // subtaskResponse checks the enum and creates the respective events 
        // + checks for delimiters, and list size
        inputCmd.subtaskResponse(taskList, input[1]); 
        break;
    } else {
        throw new DukeException("Task description cannot be empty!");
    }
// ...
}
```

</details>

---

@Spyobird thanks for sharing your views on this too! This is my first time really building anything and I was worried that I might have done some "bad practices" regarding enums. I should probably take a look at how you (and @lkldev) used polymorphism to differentiate exceptions as it sounds cleaner 😄 .

My SDK is Amazon Corretto version 11.0.14, I followed the following steps when I was trying to do the increment `A-Gradle`:
- Merged the `add-gradle-support` branch to my master branch
- Followed the tutorial for scenario 2 and then scenario 1 in this given link: [SE-EDU](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html)
- I could not even build my IP with Gradle initially, until I downloaded addressbook-Level-3 from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle), and copied the entire `config` folder to my IP working directory
- Fixed all the checkStyle error, only then I can build my iP with Gradle

### Any help regarding how to run Duke with Gradle is greatly appreciated!

If your `void` method actually prints something, i.e.`System.out.println()`, you can test your method with `PrintStream` and `ByteArrayOutputStream` class. Note that you need to set up the output stream before any tests with  `@BeforeEach` and tear down the stream after any tests with `@AfterEach`. After setting up, in your test method, simply call your method under test, and `assertEquals()` the expected printed string with your `ByteArrayOutputStream` object (note to convert the object to string and trim the automatically added \n with `toString().trim()`).

It might be due to the permissions set for the file `./runtest.sh`. Try changing the permissions by running this command in the terminal : `chmod +x ./path/to/runtest.sh`. Then you can move to the `text-ui-test` directory and directly run `./runtest.sh`. 

This worked for me on Mac.

One interesting approach I found was to incorporate enums was to use validation functions inside of it. 

There would be a public enum with all the input command types. The input strings would be validated inside an enum, and the subsequent logic can be run when the pattern of the input string matches with a particular command type. 

Sort of like how it was demonstrated [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2457104).

Did you push your code to the remote repository? If not, then the code won't be reflected on your `ip` repository. In addition, you might need to push the tags explicitly as well.

Hey everyone, I think I accidentally did a fast forward merge instead of following the instructions specified in Week 3's project.

<img width="576" alt="Screenshot 2022-01-23 at 11 42 14 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54658569/150686441-dd742aa9-3f45-4c8c-bda1-f3d8405ddeb1.png">


I have a couple questions:
1) Could someone more experienced confirm that I have done a fast forward merge between `master branch` and `branch-Level-7`?
2) Is it possible to "revert back" to the state of level 6, in order to do it in the correct manner?
3) How should I go about tagging for level 7? Because I did not create an extra merge commit, would it be okay to tag it in the fast-forwarded merge instead?

I was trying to follow the steps not to do a fast forward merge, but I got this window instead and just continued.

Hi there

I believe it is an issue with the way you run the .sh file. 

What you should do is to navigate to your text-ui-test directory in terminal (either in IntelliJ or Mac's default terminal). When in the directory, run the following:

`./runtest.sh`

If you get a permission error, use the fix @s7manth mentioned.

I will try and attempt to explain in simple terms using an example: 

Let's say you want to push branch-Level-9 to GitHub. You run `git push origin branch-Level-9` (without the -u flag).
The next time when you try to run `git pull`(while in branch-Level-9), you will be prompted with the following message:

>There is no tracking information for the current branch.
>Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
>See git-pull(1) for details.
>
>    git pull &gt;remote> &gt;branch>
>
>If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:
>
>    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/&gt;branch> branch-Level-9

This means you have to run the full command `git pull origin branch-Level-9` to pull the branch from GitHub (or configure git branch --set-upstream). 

In contrast, if you ran `git push -u origin branch-Level-9` the first time, in future you can run simply run `git pull` from branch-Level-9 as it is being treated as `git pull origin branch-Level-9`(likewise for git push).

Read more from StackOverflow [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5697750/what-exactly-does-the-u-do-git-push-u-origin-master-vs-git-push-origin-ma/16018004#16018004). The top 3 answers are pretty well explained.

There is a question for us to choose if the variable name is compliant with coding standard:

Thanks @Spyobird and prof! I understand that those keywords classify the variable as a constant which requires a certain naming convention. Actually I was wondering whether we need to follow certain order of the keywords (e.g. `static final` instead of `final static`) because I saw prof’s examples for the coding styles use `static final` instead.

From the weekly topics, it seems that JUnit testing can only be used on methods that return something, since we use assert to check whether the expected output is the same as the actual output of the method.

However, my implementation of Duke actually has quite some void return types in different classes. I tried to google and some suggested using Mockito's verify() function to do unit testing for void return types.

Is there a way to do it with JUnit? Or do void return types not need unit testing? Any advice is appreciated!

Although both ways would be fine, but from the IP task description on [**save**](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/website/schedule/week3/project.html)

> Save the tasks in the hard disk automatically whenever the task list changes. 

It means we need a `save` operation whenever there is a modification on `TaskList`, hence we should `save` after every command that modifies the `TaskList` (`mark`, `unmark`, `delete`, etc.)

From the official java doc on [JAR file](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html), the `MANIFEST.MF` contains the metadata for the JAR packaged. Since the JAR file is ignored, I think we could also ignore this file.

Originally my runtest.bat file was completely unchanged so I went ahead and replaced lines 10 and 18 with the following statements respectively:

```

There was still no change in the message. I'm not a 100% confident if those paths are what they require either so some guidance would be appreciated:) I also did do a quick google search and followed the steps on this link: https://www.java67.com/2015/07/javac-is-not-recognized-as-internal-or-external-command-program-batch-file.html#ixzz5WjtBMio9 but it didn't seem to work either:/

Hey all! As we are transitioning into Week 3 from Week 2, these 2 topics were ones I spent extra time on understanding. Here are some resources that I hope would be useful to you as they have been to me! 

## Java Enums 
As the last stretch goal of Week 2's Assignment involves the use of Enums, I was figuring out how Enums are written & can be structured to fit my implementation. The following [article](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java/enums.html) provided an overview & had some helpful tips. 

## Git/GitHub 
I've personally followed Shiffman for his [Coding Challenges](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH) & overall amazing & engaging content, but his [Git and GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV) playlist can serve as a great introduction & refresher for Git/GitHub!

I have a problem printing my output into the text file that I have specified.

I have encapsulated the creation of the file reader and writer into a class as shown below.

```java
public class FileAction {
    protected String filepath = "C:\\NUS\\CS2103\\iP\\data\\duke.txt";
    protected FileWriter file;
    protected PrintWriter writer;

    public FileAction() throws IOException {
        file = new FileWriter(filepath);
        writer = new PrintWriter(file);
    }

    public void save(String cont) {
        writer.write("Hello");
        writer.write(cont);
    }

    public void changeFilePath(String fileName) {
        filepath = fileName;
    }
}
```

Which is made used in the adding of tasks as shown below as 'f.save(t.toString());'

```java
public String add(Task t, FileAction f) {
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        String line = "____________________________________________________________ \n";
        tasks.add(t);
        res.append(line).append("Got it. I've added this task: \n");
        res.append(t.toString()).append("\n");
        res.append("Now you have ").append(tasks.size());
        res.append(" tasks in the list.\n").append(line);
        f.save(t.toString());
        return res.toString();
 }
```

Additionally, the FileAction instance is supplied through an Action class which has an instance of FileAction created before use.
 (Shown in this link: https://github.com/hsiaojietng/ip/blob/branch-Level-7/src/main/java/Action.java)

Adding tasks such as 'todo Borrow books' runs the function save() without any errors, but I do not see any text created in the text file specified, is there a reason why?

Hi! I am unable to run my JAR file because my main class Duke is not found. When I try to check my MANIFEST.MF file my Main-Class Duke cannot be resolved even though they are in the same directory. I've tried many ways to resolve this issue like moving my MANIFEST file and my jar file around the directory but none of them seem to work. Is there anybody who has faced the same problem? Been spending way too much time on this small increment.

<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: Question regarding tracking system and doing tasks ahead**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S2/forum/issues/5" expanded>

I have some questions regarding how the tracking system works and doing tasks ahead. In particular:

**1.** If we complete Week X's in video quiz before Week X, will it be counted towards the "extra" participation for Week X. Also, do I need to answer all in-video quizzes of Week X to get the participation, or answering some of them will do?

**2.** Are we allowed to complete iP tasks for week X before week X? For example, if I completed (some or all) of Week 3's task before Week 3, commit and tag before Week 3, and push to my fork only during Week 3, will my commits and tags be tracked?

**3.** Under "Project Management" component for iP, one of the criteria is "submit some deliverables in at least 4 out of 5 iP weeks". Consider the scenario in question 2 above, will I be considered as "submitting some deliverables in Week 3" if I completed Week 3 tasks beforehand and only push in Week 3 (assuming I did not do any Week 4 tasks in Week 3)? What if, in addition to that, I complete some of all of Week 4's task in Week 3. Will I then be considered as "submitting some deliverables (week 4 tasks) in week 3"? 

**4.** Do "deliverables" refer to only commits tagged with the given tags? In the case if I completed all tagged tasks for Week 6 in Week 5, there will be no more "tags" for me to complete. Can I submit some untagged commits in Week 6 to be considered as "submitting some deliverables in Week 6"?

Not sure if this is recommended but I used enum to define error strings and grouped them together.  This makes my program more organized in handling errors and easier for me to change my error strings (By looking up the enum and modifying the relevant error string).

Another possibility is using enum to store the valid commands (i.e. list, todo, deadline, etc.). This allows for enums to be used as a validation tool, to check if the incoming input is a valid command based on the aforementioned fields.

I have 2 other classes in ip/src/java, Task and TaskList. I am able to call methods from both classes in the main Duke class. However, I cannot call Task methods in TaskList and vice versa (cannot resolve method). String.format(...) also does not work in both Task and TaskList for some reason. Does anyone know how to resolve this issue? Thank you.

Personally I don't see why this could be confusing. The client should not know and have anything to do with the `isDone` private boolean field, and the implementation shouldn't be using the `isDone()` public accessor method.

And although there could be some scenarios where an accessor method is necessary, I feel that it is usually possible to refactor the code such that accessor methods are unnecessary. For example, instead of checking if a ToDo task is done, we can focus on what we need to do with that information, and request the ToDo class handle that instead. This way we don't have to do `isDone()` accessor.

Hi, 

 Could I clarify about the format of how we store the files for Level-7. Does it have to be a text based (.txt), or can we store it by using the Serializable interface which will result in the Task objects being stored in a .ser file ?

Thanks!

Adding on to what @lzan98 said, 'track the new upstream branch' means creating a connection between your new local branch and remote branch (upstream). See diagram below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56408987/150775287-c8fe53d3-0481-42e0-bb6e-4efdabab8cec.png)

This connection lets you obtain information from your remote repositories, such as telling you if your commits are ahead/behind the remote branch. For example, in a project collaboration scenario, you will most likely be working on the same branch with other people and there will be frequent pushes on the same branch. Hence, when performing a "git fetch" command, you can bring the new commits from your remote repository and you can choose to merge them at will.

Another reason is that you can perform git pull and push quickly as git already knows which upstream branch to push/pull from.

Hope this helps =). You can read more from [here](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/track-remote-upstream-branch)

Hello, 

The way I did it was - whenever the user starts the program the data is loaded from the file to an ArrayList. Throughout the execution of the program the data manipulation takes place in the ArrayList and when the user types the exit command the data from the ArrayList is written back to the file. Writing back to file after every command may be too cumbersome, it is easier to write back to file in one go after the program has finished execution.

TL;DR: I save the data on termination.

Hey @zxgoh, not sure if it's relevant, but have you set the `JAVA_HOME` system variable? Assuming your shell is zsh, try adding this line to your `~/.zshrc` file:

`export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 11.0.14)`

On a side note, I am also experiencing the same text corruption issue. I have an m1 MacBook and have thus installed the recommended version of Java, but the text still appears broken. What else can I do to fix this? Thank you!

EDIT: I think I found a solution for my setup, I tried running `addressbook.jar` from the terminal instead of Finder. Calling `java -jar addressbook.jar` seems to work for me; the text doesn't get corrupted this way.

Have you tried right-clicking the "main" folder and selecting "Mark Directory as Sources Root"? You could also try renaming the package "duke.task" under "Refactor" to not include a period.

It seems that you can call it if the test is in the same package. You can find some more details in https://junit.org/junit4/faq.html#atests_10

However, this documentation is from junit4, so if it doesn't work, you can try this approach of creating a subclass that calls the protected method for testing purposes only.
